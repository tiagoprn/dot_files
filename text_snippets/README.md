# text snippets

The execution permission is important to the script that reads the files here.

There are 2 types of files here:

- text files (without the execution permission): those are files on which the contents will be copied as it is, with no changes.
- script files (bash script files with the execution permission): those are scripts that generate text that will be copied.

So, when inserting a new file here, make sure you observe the 2 types of files description above to decide if that must be a script or a text file, and pay special attention to its permissions.
