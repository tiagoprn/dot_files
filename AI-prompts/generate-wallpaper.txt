I want a wallpaper in 4K resolution of the sky of a hypothetical planet around a blue star.
The planet is on the habitable zone.
On the surface, I want water and vegetation.
On the sky, it must have stars with varying colors and flying animals.
All elements on the image: vegetation, animals and stars must be scientifically accurate.
The plant colors must be optimized for energy gathering from the generated star.
Before generating the image, tell if you can generate a scientifically accurate image with those parameters and proceed if so.
If not, do not generate it and tell what changes need to be done for that.
