Based on a previous conversation we had about flashcards, here are some key points I want you to take into consideration:

- I want to base the cards I create on scientific principles underlying effective flashcard usage
- I want to make use of the bidirectional testing approach
- I want to make use of the Markdown format for each card, based on this template:

``` markdown card file

## Card
id: <unix_timestamp_here>
Q: question here
A: answer here
QR: reverse question here (turn the original answer into the question)
AR: reverse answer here (turn the original question into the answer)
Tags: tag1, tag2, ...

```

- I also use a journal file to track my progress through the cards. This is an example:

``` markdown journal file

# Tracking Journal

## Card Status Legend
- Status: EASY (21 days), GOOD (14 days), HARD (7 days), FORGOT (1 day)
- Format: id, direction(A/AR), status, current_interval, next_review_date

## 2025-01-29 (First review)
- 1706515200, A, GOOD, 14, 2025-02-12     # You remembered well, but not perfectly
- 1706515200, AR, EASY, 21, 2025-02-19    # The reverse was very easy for you
- 1706515300, A, FORGOT, 1, 2025-01-30    # You couldn't remember the full definition
- 1706515300, AR, GOOD, 14, 2025-02-12    # The reverse was easier

## 2025-01-30 (Review of forgotten card)
- 1706515300, A, HARD, 7, 2025-02-06      # You remembered, but with difficulty

## 2025-02-06 (Review of HARD card)
- 1706515300, A, GOOD, 14, 2025-02-20     # You're improving!

## 2025-02-12 (Multiple cards due)
- 1706515200, A, EASY, 21, 2025-03-05     # You're mastering this direction
- 1706515300, AR, GOOD, 14, 2025-02-26    # Maintaining good recall


```

Based on this approach, I will send you some notes and I want you to generate a markdown file with flashcards based on the markdown card file I sent you above.
