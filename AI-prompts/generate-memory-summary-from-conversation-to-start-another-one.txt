Can you please give me some context of this conversation we had, with the main points.
I want that in a way that can be useful to you on another conversation I will begin, since you do not retain memory from our conversations.

---

I will provide a summary of a conversation we had before that was generated by you at the end.
I want you to confirm you can move on with that context, so I can continue from it.
