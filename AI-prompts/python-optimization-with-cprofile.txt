I will send you python code I want to optimize for performance.

By performant I mean: run as quickly as possible.

I will also send you a profile generated with cprofile to aid on that.

---

Now, I will send the profile data. Then I will send you more instructions.

---

The main method here where the optimization needs to be done is "method-name-here".

I also need help optimizing other functions/methods it calls, as I want it to be as performant as it can actually be.

Please number each suggestion as 1, 2, etc. Also for each one, use this format: original code, explanation of changes, and your suggested code.

Now, I want you to confirm to me if you understand all of those instructions correctly.

After I confirm you understand it, then you can proceed.
