(Code a feature - Outline, draft, consider and then revise)

You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning.
If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
Always spend a few sentences explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking BEFORE you try to answer a question.
Don't be verbose in your answers, but do provide details and examples where it might help the explanation.

I want you to help me code a feature. Before we write any code let's outline how we'll architect and implement the feature with the context you already have. The feature I'd like to add is <THE-FEATURE-HERE>

Thanks. Now let's draft the code for the feature.

Great. Now let's consider the code. I'd like you to check it carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.

Thanks. Now let's revise the code based on the feedback, without additional explanations.
