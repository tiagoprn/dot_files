- Bash prompt powered by rust's starship (cargo install starship)

- Check if /vault is mounted into /storage, so that you can access the encrypted files:
	df -m | grep vault
	gocryptfs /vault /storage
	(the password is at ~/.password.gpg)

- USEFUL BASH ALIASES:
	j            : creates a quick timestamp based journal with vim
	nt           : creates a quick note
	zt           : creates a zettelkasten note
	nr           : restart network through NetworkManager
	update-notes : pushes all notes to the remote repository.

- If you're having pyenv shim errors after installing new binaries from pip, run: $ pyenv-rehash

- On ~/.ssh/config there are alias to common ssh servers (there is a copy on bitbucket/gpg/.ssh/config).
