# In short, this script takes a process name (which is a class name or instance name, obtainable by xprop) and searches for it. Then, it applies a rule based on its status:
# Status 			Rule
# ------			____
# Non-existent 		Launch
# Visible 		Hide
# Hidden 			Show

# Sometimes a process name will differ from its executable, so thereâ€™s also an option to specify an executable name.

# Also, some programs will spawn multiple instances, while only the first one actually matters, so it implements a --take-first switcher to apply the show/hide only on the first instance of that program.
